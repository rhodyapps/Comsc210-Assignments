Github CheatSheet:

Below are some commonly used Git commands

Git Commands in VS Code terminal

1. Connecting a local project with a Github Repository

If you created a project from scratch, without cloning a Github project:
 - first use git init to establish a local Git repository for this project

git init  

- next create a new repository on Github and copy the url
-  back in VS Code terminal point the project to the Github repository:

git remote add origin <paste in the url to your Github repository>

2. Connecting a cloned repository with your own Github repository

- After you have cloned the repository go into VS Code and run 'npm install' to update project dependencies:

npm install

- Fix or update any dependencies. Run 'npm audit fix' to update the dependencies in the local repository

npm audit fix

- Show the project Fetch and Pull pointers:

git remote show origin

- if the remote origin is not pointing to your Github repo for this project, first remove the pointer::

git remote rm origin

- then go into your Github and get the url for the repository that you want to use for this project (create a new repository if necessary). Copy the url to the Github repository. Then in VS Code:

- git remote add origin <paste in the url>


3. Add your new project to Github Desktop

- Go into Github Desktop and click 'Add existing repository'
- click on the 'choose path' to navigate to the local repository for the project you want to add.

4. How to merge a branch into the master branch (or another branch)

- Merging begins with creating a 'Pull Request' 
- First push all your changes for the branch you want to merge to Github.
- Then in Github select the branch that you want to merge and click on 'create pull request'
